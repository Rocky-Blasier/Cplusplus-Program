# Cplusplus-Program
Project Summary

For the project, I did the Corner Grocer project in which I was instructed to write a C++ program that accepts grocery transaction data. The program counts the number of times each item appears, allows the user to search for specific items, and builds a frequency histogram. The project solved the problem of helping a small grocery store know more about customers' buying habits through simple-to-grasp automated reports.

What I Did Well

I believe I performed very well in organizing the program format and keeping the code readable and understandable. I also included insightful remarks to help someone unfamiliar with the code grasp its reasoning.

Opportunities for Development

One area I would enhance is optimizing data handling. The current program reads line by line and is based on simple structures. Adding more sophisticated data structures (e.g., maps or hash tables) would make it efficient and scalable if the data set size grows. I would also enhance security with stricter input verification to prevent non-expected crashes.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them

The hardest part of the project was generating the histogram and having the output correct and readable. My original output formatting was incorrect at first. I overcame this by using string format utilities and trying many different outputs until I had a neat, consistent format. I also used online documentation and IDE debugging capabilities to step through the code and verify where errors were happening.

Transferable Skills

This project solidified my skills in:

Input/output of files in C++

Data enumeration and organization using loops and containers

Testing and debugging programmatically

Writing code that is organized and well-documented

These can all be applied to upcoming programming classes and practical development projects that frequently involve data processing and analysis.


Code Quality (Readability, Adaptability, and Maintainability)

Using descriptive variable names, consistent indentation, and comments that clarify each function's purpose, I concentrated on writing maintainable code. In order to facilitate future expansion, I further divided the program into logically separate sections.  If more features are required—such as outputting reports to a file or adding more menu items—the organization is there to add expansion without much rewriting.
